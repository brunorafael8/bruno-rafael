        I am self-taught, I learn as much as possible about programming and
        design and to keep up with technological innovations. As a software
        engineer at LUXCLUSIF, I create web products for a luxury fashion
        company that provides rental, sale, and authentication services for
        exclusive items. I use HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React, NextJs, Jest, and
        react-testing-library to develop the front-end of the company's
        products, applying web design principles and best practices for
        accessibility, usability, and performance.
        <br /><br /> I also help to empower and mentor new developers who join the
        company, sharing my knowledge and skills. I am passionate about
        programming and design and always eager to learn new technologies and
        innovations, especially in user experience and web development. I am
        pursuing a degree in Systems Analysis and Development at Descomplica
        Faculdade Digital, an innovative and quality education institution. I
        aim to create solutions that make a difference in people's lives and the
        market.
